## Description 📜

This Python script allows you to perform arithmetic calculations based on an operator provided as input. In addition to basic arithmetic, it also checks if the values fall within certain ranges and returns specific labels.

## Features ✨
- **Addition**: It sums two numbers when the operator is `"+"`.
- **Conditional Checks**: Based on the operator, it checks if both numbers are below a certain threshold and prints a label:
    - If both numbers are ≤ 60, it prints `"c"`.
    - If both numbers are ≤ 75, it prints `"b"`.
    - Otherwise, it prints `"a"`.
